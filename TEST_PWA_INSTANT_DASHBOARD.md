# PWA Instant Dashboard Access - Testing Guide

## Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Before You Start
- Have a coach or owner account ready
- Use Chrome/Edge/Safari on mobile or desktop
- Enable PWA installation if testing on mobile

### Test Steps

#### 1. First Login Test
```
1. Open browser (incognito/private mode recommended)
2. Go to your app URL
3. ✓ VERIFY: Landing page shows immediately
4. Click "Login"
5. Login as coach or owner
6. ✓ VERIFY: Redirected to dashboard
```

#### 2. PWA Install & Reopen Test (PRIMARY TEST)
```
1. Install app as PWA (Chrome: "Install app" / iOS: "Add to Home Screen")
2. Use the app normally for a minute (navigate between pages)
3. Close the PWA completely
   - Android: Swipe away from recents
   - iOS: Swipe up and away
   - Desktop: Close window completely
4. WAIT 10 seconds
5. Tap/click PWA icon to reopen
6. ✓ VERIFY: 
   - You see a brief loading screen with logo (< 500ms)
   - Dashboard appears directly
   - NO landing page
   - NO 3-5 second wait
```

#### 3. Extended Absence Test
```
1. Login and use app
2. Close PWA
3. Don't open for 2-3 days
4. Open PWA again
5. ✓ VERIFY: Still goes directly to dashboard (no landing page)
```

#### 4. Role-Based Routing Test
Test each role separately:

**Coach:**
```
1. Login as coach
2. Close app
3. Reopen
4. ✓ VERIFY: Goes to /coach/dashboard
```

**Owner:**
```
1. Login as owner
2. Close app
3. Reopen
4. ✓ VERIFY: Goes to /dashboard
```

**Super Admin:**
```
1. Login as super-admin
2. Close app
3. Reopen
4. ✓ VERIFY: Goes to /super-admin/dashboard
```

#### 5. Logout Test
```
1. Login and use app
2. Logout
3. Close app
4. Reopen
5. ✓ VERIFY: Landing page shows (cache cleared)
```

## Developer Testing

### Check Console Logs
Open browser console and look for:
```
✓ No auth errors
✓ No "role not found" warnings
✓ Clean navigation (no double redirects)
```

### Check localStorage
Open DevTools > Application > Local Storage:
```javascript
// After login, should see:
mad:cachedUserRole: "coach" | "owner" | "super-admin"
mad:lastProtectedPath: "/coach/dashboard" | "/dashboard" | etc.

// After logout, should be empty:
mad:cachedUserRole: (empty)
mad:lastProtectedPath: (empty)
```

### Network Tab
When reopening PWA as logged-in user:
```
✓ Minimal API calls on initial load
✓ Auth state loaded from cache
✓ No unnecessary Firestore reads
✓ Page loads in < 1 second
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Timings

**First-time user (cold start):**
- Landing page render: < 200ms
- Login process: ~1-2s
- Dashboard load: ~500ms

**Returning user (warm start):**
- App icon tap → Dashboard visible: < 1s
- Loading screen duration: < 500ms
- Zero landing page flash: 0ms (shouldn't appear)

**Previously (before optimization):**
- App icon tap → Dashboard visible: 3-5s
- Landing page flash: 3-5s (every time)

## What Success Looks Like

### ✅ Success Indicators
- [ ] No landing page flash for logged-in users
- [ ] Dashboard appears in < 1 second
- [ ] Smooth native-app-like experience
- [ ] Correct role-based routing
- [ ] Clean logout and cache clearing

### ❌ Failure Indicators
- Landing page flashes before dashboard
- "Role not found" errors in console
- User gets redirected to wrong dashboard
- Cache not clearing on logout
- > 2 second delay to dashboard

## Debugging

### If Landing Page Still Flashes
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify localStorage has cached role:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.getItem('mad:cachedUserRole')
   ```
3. Check if auth.currentUser is available:
   ```javascript
   firebase.auth().currentUser
   ```
4. Clear all cache and try again

### If Wrong Dashboard Loads
1. Check cached role matches actual user role
2. Verify Firestore user document has correct role
3. Clear localStorage and login again

### If Cache Doesn't Clear on Logout
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Manually clear:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('mad:cachedUserRole')
   localStorage.removeItem('mad:lastProtectedPath')
   ```
3. File a bug report

## Browser Compatibility

### Tested Browsers
- ✅ Chrome (Android, Desktop)
- ✅ Safari (iOS, Desktop)
- ✅ Edge (Desktop)
- ✅ Firefox (Desktop)

### PWA Requirements
- HTTPS required (or localhost for dev)
- Service worker support
- Web App Manifest support
- localStorage support

## Rollback

If critical issues occur, revert `/src/app/page.tsx`:

```bash
cd /Users/ram/myacademydask
git checkout HEAD -- src/app/page.tsx src/contexts/auth-context.tsx
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
npm run build
```
